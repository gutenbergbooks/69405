<br><span class="cheaderfont">How Bolo Got His Dinner</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Bolo crept carefully through the tall grass. With one
brown hand he parted the stalks before him, and in the
other he carried a noose made from a slender willow
withe. His bright, black eyes peered cautiously about at
every step.</p>

<p>Some distance ahead of him a small gray rabbit was
hopping slowly along, stopping here and there to take a
nibble of tender, young grass, or to stand up on his hind
legs and look about him. Bolo was hungry and he
thought a little rabbit would make him a good dinner.</p>

<p>Closer and closer he crept. He raised the noose for a
throw. Then all at once the little animal pricked up his
long ears, gave one startled look ahead and plunged off
into the thick grass.</p>

<p>At the same moment a boy about as large as Bolo broke
through the grass just beyond where the rabbit had
stood. He did not see the rabbit. All he saw was Bolo
standing with arm upraised and an angry frown on his
dark face.</p>

<p>Bolo struck at the boy with his willow wand. He was
very angry at him for scaring away the rabbit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p>“Why do you strike at me?” said the boy, whose name
was Fisher.</p>

<p>“You drove away my dinner,” said Bolo fiercely.</p>

<p>“I did not see any dinner,” replied Fisher.</p>

<p>“It was a fine rabbit,” said Bolo sulkily, “and I am
very hungry.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said the boy. “Let us go and catch a fish.”</p>

<p>Bolo’s face grew less angry.</p>

<p>“I cannot catch fish,” he said. “I can only catch
rabbits.”</p>

<p>“I will show you how,” said Fisher.</p>

<p>Bolo saw that Fisher had something in his hand. It
was a long, stout cord of reindeer sinew, and on one end
of it was tied a splinter of bone. The splinter was sharp
at both ends and the cord was fastened to the middle
of it.</p>

<p>The boys left the thick grass and ran down the slope
to the river.</p>

<p>There were many trees growing near it, and some of
them had long branches which hung out over the water.
Fisher caught hold of a branch and swung himself nimbly
into a tree. Then he crawled out on a limb that reached
out over the river. Bolo followed him.</p>

<p>“We must be very still now,” said Fisher.</p>

<p>He unwound the roll of sinew and dropped the bone
splinter into the water. It was only two or three minutes
before Bolo saw a shining fish leap up and catch it.</p>

<p>Fisher laughed and pulled the fish out of the water.
But before he could get hold of it, it had struggled loose
and fallen into the river again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<p>“I think I can catch a fish,” said Bolo.</p>

<p>He slid down the tree and crept close to the edge of
the water. He kept very still. In a few minutes he saw
a big fish come very close to the shore. He made a
quick spring and caught it in his hands.</p>

<p>Fisher came down the tree quickly.</p>

<p>“I could not catch a fish like that,” he said.</p>

<p>“I catch rabbits that way sometimes,” said Bolo.</p>

<p>The boys were so hungry that they did not wait to
catch any more fish. They climbed back into the tree
and sat down on a limb. They rubbed the fish against
the rough bark to loosen the scales, then they tore pieces
of flesh out with their fingers and ate them raw.</p>

<p>After they had eaten all they wanted they threw the
rest on the ground.</p>

<p>“Now I will catch you,” said Bolo.</p>

<p>“Come on then,” cried Fisher.</p>

<p>What a queer race it was! They did not run on the
ground as boys do now, but swung from limb to limb
through the trees. Fisher was very strong and quick,
and he dodged and climbed so nimbly that Bolo was soon
left some distance behind.</p>

<p>At last they came to the edge of the woods. There
were no more trees very close, and Bolo thought Fisher
would have to turn back.</p>

<p>“I will get you now,” shouted Bolo.</p>

<p>But Fisher slipped down to the end of a long, slender
limb and hung with his hands. He swung back and
forth farther and farther at each swing. Before Bolo
could reach him he had flung himself far out toward a<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
tree that stood by itself several yards from the edge of
the woods, and with a daring leap, had landed among its
branches.</p>

<p>Bolo laughed and started to slide down the limb too.
He thought he could leap as far as Fisher could. Then
he glanced down to the ground and began to climb back
up the tree as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>“The cave bear! the cave bear!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Fisher glanced down, too, and his face had a look of
great fear on it as he realized the danger he had been in.</p>

<p>There on the ground below them was an immense black
bear, growling and reaching up the trunk of the tree as
far as she could.</p>

<p>Bolo was badly frightened. He did not think any
more about the race. He clambered back among the
trees as fast as he could.</p>

<p>But Fisher did not dare to leap back the way he had
come. He thought he would stay where he was. He
knew if he should fall the bear would very quickly tear
him to pieces.</p>

<p>When Bolo had got quite a distance from the bear he
stopped. He could still hear her growling and tearing at
the bark. He was glad he was safe, but he was sorry
Fisher could not get away, too. He thought that if Fisher
did not get away he would no longer have a playmate.</p>

<p>Then he thought of something else and ran on through
the branches as fast as he could go.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

</div>


<p>It did not take Bolo long to get back to the Valley of
Caves. The cave where he lived was near the river, not
far from the place where he and Fisher had caught their
dinner. When he came in sight of it he slid down out of
the trees and ran quickly across the open space.</p>

<p>“The bear! the bear!” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>His mother, whose name was Stitcher, was making a
wolf-skin coat for One Eye, his father. She was sitting
on the ground in front of the cave. She was sewing
with a long, slender bone needle, and the thread she
used was made of reindeer sinew.</p>

<p>When she heard Bolo shouting she jumped up quickly
and ran to catch up little Antelope, her baby, who was
playing near by. Then she ran for the cave.</p>

<p>“The bear! the bear!” screamed Bolo over and over.
He was out of breath from running, and that was all he
could say.</p>

<p>Stitcher at once began to throw dry wood on the fire
just inside the cave. She knew that no bear would dare
to enter as long as she kept the fire blazing.</p>

<p>It was some time before the excited boy could make
her understand where the bear was. She thought it was
coming to the cave. But when she found out the danger
Fisher was in she stood for a minute thinking.</p>

<p>“The men are all gone,” she said. “They have all the
spears and harpoons. Here is a strong bow, but there
are only three arrows. You can not kill a bear with
arrows.”</p>

<p>“I will try,” said Bolo eagerly.</p>

<p>Not many men in the Clan could shoot with a bow.
They had always used spears and harpoons. They made
the heads of them out of flintstones. One Eye had been
the first man in the Clan to make arrows. He had
learned how from a stranger who had once visited the
Clan. One Eye thought the arrows much better than the
spears, but most of the men liked their old weapons best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<p>Bolo had never shot an arrow himself, but he had seen
his father do so many times. When he thought of the
savage bear growling at the foot of the tree he was afraid.
Then he thought how brave One Eye was, and of the
terrible battle with the auroch which had cost him one
of his eyes and had earned for him the name of being
the boldest man in the Clan. That had happened many
years ago when One Eye was a boy like Bolo.</p>

<p>“I will shoot the bear,” he said again, and his voice
was more eager than before.</p>

<p>His mother gave him the stout bow and the three arrows.
He ran back to the trees as fast as he could go.
When he got to the nearest one he took the bow and arrows
firmly between his knees and grasped the lowest
limb with both hands. In a minute he had drawn himself
up and was scurrying back through the branches to
the place where poor Fisher was waiting.</p>

<p>He found the boy just where he had left him. The
big bear was growling fiercely and walking around the
tree. Often she would stop and reach up as far as she
could with her forepaws, tearing viciously at the bark
and snarling with rage.</p>

<p>When Fisher saw Bolo coming he shouted for joy. He
did not think Bolo would come back. Cave people did
not often think of helping each other. Each had to take
care of himself.</p>

<p>“Now see me shoot the bear,” called Bolo proudly,
fitting one of the precious arrows to the bow.</p>

<p>“Twang!” went the bowstring.</p>

<p>But Bolo was so excited that the arrow flew wide of<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
its mark. The bear roared more angrily than ever.</p>

<p>Bolo sat down on a thick limb. He was not so sure of
killing the bear now. He fitted the next arrow very
carefully and waited till the bear had turned so as to face
him. Then he drew the shaft back against the taut string
and took steady aim.</p>

<p>“Twang!” went the second arrow.</p>

<p>What a roar there was then! The arrow pierced the
bear’s shaggy hide just above her shoulder and she rolled
over and over on the ground, clawing at it and howling
with pain and anger. But presently she was up again,
tearing madly at the tree where Bolo was sitting.</p>

<div id="Ref_012" class="figcenter illowp78" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i012.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“<a href="#BRef_012">There was only one arrow left</a>”</p></div>
</div>

<p><a id="BRef_012" href="#Ref_012">There was only one arrow left</a>. Bolo’s face grew very
sober as he fitted it to the string. If he should not kill
the bear this time poor Fisher would have to stay where
he was until some of the men came home. He might
grow so weary that he could not hold on any longer, and
then the bear would eat him.</p>

<p>But if he could kill the bear! Ah, then he would be a
hero indeed—a great hero like One Eye. And then,
too, the cave men would all see what a fine weapon the
arrow was, and they would know that One Eye was wiser
than they were. But even One Eye had not thought a
bear could be killed with arrows.</p>

<p>Bolo waited until the bear was over her first rage and
had grown quiet again. By and by she paused a moment
with her forepaws against the tree, looking up into the
branches. Bolo took careful aim right at her small,
wicked-looking eye.</p>

<p>The third time the arrow flew from the string. And<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
this time it went straight to its mark! The bear shrieked
with agony and reared up on her hind legs. Then she
rolled over on her side in the grass. Bolo waited to
see if she would get up. Then he called to Fisher.</p>

<p>With a wild whoop, both boys slid down to the ground.
At first they did not dare to go very near the bear.
Fisher picked up a stone and threw it at her, but she did
not move. Then how the boys danced and shouted!</p>

<p>But Bolo soon thought of something else.</p>

<p>“The wolves will come,” he said.</p>

<p>“We must hurry back to the caves,” said Fisher.</p>

<p>“Then we will not have any bear meat,” returned Bolo.</p>

<p>“We must save the meat if we can,” said Fisher.
“But we are only two boys, and the wolves are many and
fierce.”</p>

<p>“Gather some dry wood quickly,” said Bolo. “I will
run back and bring a torch.”</p>

<p>It did not take long for the boys to make a circle of
blazing sticks around the carcass of the bear. But almost
before it was done they could hear the terrible howl
of the hungry wolves, and they knew the pack was
closing in about them. Fisher was frightened and wished
they had left the meat for the wolves. But Bolo only
laughed loudly, and threw stones through the wall of fire
at the wolves, and called tauntingly to them. He knew
they were safe so long as the fire burned.</p>

<p>Pretty soon it grew dark, and still the hungry wolves
howled around the wall of fire, pacing restlessly up and
down and watching for a place to break through it. The
boys were getting tired. Besides, all the dry wood they<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
had been able to gather would soon be gone, and then
what would they do? They could save themselves by
climbing into the trees, but then they would have to give
up their bear, and such a supply of meat was a prize. It
meant a feast of many days for the whole Clan.</p>

<p>“If I had more arrows I would shoot the wolves, too,”
said Bolo; “then we could go wherever we liked.
When we get back to the cave I will ask my father to
teach me how to make them for myself.”</p>

<p>“I hear someone shouting,” said Fisher, just as the
dawn was beginning to show above the treetops.</p>

<p>Both boys called out as loudly as they could. In another
minute they were answered.</p>

<p>“We are coming,” shouted the men.</p>

<p>The men carried blazing branches in their hands. They
came running toward the snarling wolf pack, screaming
and waving the firebrands about their heads. The
wolves quickly slunk away among the trees and did not
dare to come near again.</p>

<p>What a time there was when the men came back to the
Valley of Caves bringing the bear. Bolo and Fisher had
to tell over and over how it had all happened, and just
how the arrow had killed the great beast. One Eye was
very proud, partly because the people knew now what
good things arrows were, and partly because Bolo had
shown himself to be such a hero.</p>

<p>“He has learned a great lesson,” said One Eye. “He
has learned how to take care of himself like a man.”</p>

<p>“You must teach me to make arrows,” said Bolo.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said One Eye, “that shall be your next lesson.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III
<br><span class="cheaderfont">The Flood and the Fire</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In a cave close to the river a very old woman lived by
herself. She did not do any work. The cave people
brought her everything she needed to eat, and when she
wanted a new garment Stitcher made it for her. She
had something more important to do than to gather food
or sew skins. She had to take care of the Great Fire.</p>

<p>Sometimes the fire in the other caves went out. Then
Flame, for that was the old woman’s name, had to light
a torch at the fire in her cave and give it to the person
who needed it. So of course the Great Fire must never
go out for if it did no one knew how to get any more.</p>

<p>No one knew where Flame got the fire in her cave.
Her mother was Keeper of the Great Fire for the Clan
as far back as the oldest men could remember. She
taught Flame how to talk to the Fire-god and persuade
him to give her the fire, but Flame had never told anyone
else. She liked to be the fire-keeper herself.</p>

<p>Bolo and Fisher often went to Flame’s cave. They
liked to watch the great blaze always burning on the big
flat rock just inside the entrance to her cave. They
brought her dry wood for it, and sometimes she would
let them roast nuts or broil slices of meat or fish over the
smaller fire where she cooked her own food. She would
never allow them to go very near the Great Fire on the
big hearth, and she never used that one to cook her food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>Bolo and Fisher often played in Flame’s cave. There
was a small hole away at the back of it where they could
crawl out into the sunlight. Flame did not like this hole.
She was afraid some wild animal might come through it.
So she told the boys always to roll a great rock against
it when they were through playing. This was the first
door any of the Clan had ever had.</p>

<p>When it rained the cave people stayed at home. They
were warm and dry in the big caves. They always kept
great piles of dry wood stored away so that the fires
rarely went out. The little children played about in the
firelight. The women, with Stitcher to teach them,
pounded the skins soft or sewed them into garments.
The men busied themselves making new points for their
spears and harpoons. But One Eye always made arrow
heads instead, and since Bolo killed the cave bear many
of the men came to his cave to be taught how to make
them, too. Many were beginning to think arrows much
better than their old weapons, but some of the old men
still declared they were of no use.</p>

<p>Once it began to rain, and for many days the clouds
never broke and rain fell constantly. The season was
warm and the boys had a great deal of fun running about
in the wet. They always left their skin coats in the caves
when they did that, for if the skins got very wet it made
them stiff and hard.</p>

<p>At first this was sport, but as the days went on and
the torrents still poured down the cave people began to
get uneasy. Their stock of wood was running low, too,
and the weather was turning colder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>“How high the river is running,” said Fisher one day.
“And see how many branches, and even great trees, are
floating down on it.”</p>

<p>“It is almost up to the hole in the back of Flame’s
cave,” said Bolo.</p>

<p>“We had better go and tell her,” said Fisher. So away
they went to Flame’s cave.</p>

<p>“The water never comes into my cave,” said Flame.</p>

<p>“But it is coming now,” cried Bolo in alarm. And
sure enough, a little trickle of muddy water was running
across the floor.</p>

<p>Flame looked at the tiny stream anxiously.</p>

<p>“We must roll the great rock closer,” she said.</p>

<p>Bolo and Fisher ran to put the big rock in place. Then
they tried to daub mud about the edges to keep the water
out. But it did no good. The stream was constantly
growing larger, and Flame grew frightened.</p>

<p>“The water will put out the Great Fire,” she said.
“Ah, see! It is coming in at the front of the cave, too.”</p>

<p>“It will drown us,” cried Fisher and Bolo in great fear.
“Let us run away from it.”</p>

<p>As they hastened out of the cave they saw people hurrying
here and there in great confusion. Bolo saw his
mother with little Antelope on her arm. She was running
toward the trees. He saw One Eye, too, and wondered
what he had in the great skin bag he was carrying.</p>

<p>Everyone was screaming and calling, and everywhere
he looked he saw the muddy river. It had broken over
its banks and was flooding all the land. How fast it came!</p>

<p>Higher and higher it grew, with a great rush like the<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
breaking of a big wave on the ocean; and before Bolo and
Fisher could get to the trees it was nearly to their knees.</p>

<p>The boys never forgot that terrible time. For many
long hours the rain fell in gusty sheets, and below them,
as they sat huddled close together on a big limb, they
could see nothing but brown, rushing water. They called
sometimes, and at first one or another of the cave people
would answer. Once Bolo heard his mother’s voice.
But after a while there were no more answers.</p>

<p>Then it began to grow very cold. The boys could not
keep warm even by sitting very close together. In the
clouded light they could see groups of cave people on the
hills about the Valley. As they looked at one group, to
their horror, they saw a great pack of wolves fighting
through the water to reach the same high place. From
another hilltop they could hear the snarling of frightened
and savage hyenas.</p>

<p>“It is better in the trees,” said Bolo.</p>

<p>“I wonder where Flame has gone,” said Fisher.</p>

<p>It seemed to Bolo as if they must die before the rain
ceased and the flood went down. Their hands grew so
stiff that they could hardly hold to the limbs. Dark came,
and daylight, and dark again, they could not tell how
many times, and still the water raged below them. Once
in the night they felt something strike the tree, and in the
morning the body of a great wildcat hung limply across
the end of the limb.</p>

<p>“I am glad he was dead before he found our tree,” said
Bolo with a shudder.</p>

<p>When the rain stopped at last and the water began to<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
go down the boys could hardly move. They tried to call,
but their lips were stiff and would not make much sound.
Now and then, as the water whirled past, the ghastly face
of a drowned cave man would glimmer for a moment below
them, only to be swallowed up at once by the grim,
brown water.</p>

<p>The water went down as fast as it had risen. As soon
as it was safe the boys slid stiffly to the ground and
limped back to the caves. They were hungry and cold
and miserable, and they thought how good the fire would
feel. But though they searched long and carefully
through the sodden ashes they could not find so much as
a single spark.</p>

<p>By and by more of the cave people began to come back
home, one by one. Frantically they searched through
the desolate caves for a glimmer of fire, but none could
be found. They were in despair. How could they live
without fire? There would be no way to cook their food
or to warm themselves when it grew cold. And, worst
of all, there would now be no way to keep the wild beasts
out of the caves, and all of the people would have to go
back to the trees to live, as did their fore-parents so long,
long ago. They were very wretched, and could do nothing
but huddle together in groups, trying to realize all
that the loss of their fires would mean to them.</p>

<p>But where was Flame? Perhaps if they could find her
she could help them. They thought she knew where the
Fire-god lived and could get him to send them fire.</p>

<p>“Let us see if we can find Flame,” said Bolo.</p>

<p>So he and Fisher started out to look for her.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV
<br><span class="cheaderfont">The God Who Lived in the Sun</span></h2>
</div>


<p>By this time the sun was shining brightly. The boys
held out their stiffened hands and thought how good and
warm the sunshine felt.</p>

<p>“It is like the Great Fire,” said Fisher.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the Fire-god lives in the sun,” whispered
Bolo, looking toward it with an awed expression on his
dark face.</p>

<p>As they came near Flame’s cave they saw that she was
there, sure enough. She was down on her knees in front
of the entrance, making strange motions with her hands.
They thought she was looking for something.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute.” Bolo caught Fisher by the arm and
drew him back. “Let us see what she is doing.”</p>

<p>Just then she slowly rose to her feet. She turned her
face toward the sun and stretched her lean arms up as
far as she could. Her long gray hair streamed out behind
her and her eyes were very bright. She looked as if
she was seeing something a long way off. Her lips moved.</p>

<p>“She is talking to the sun,” said Fisher in a frightened
whisper. “Perhaps she is calling the Fire-god.”</p>

<p>The boys came cautiously nearer. They were not
afraid of Flame, but they were not sure what might happen
next. And they were very curious to hear what she<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
was saying. By and by Flame turned and saw the boys.
She beckoned them to come nearer.</p>

<p>“The Water-god is great,” she said in a solemn voice,
“but greater is the Fire-god. He has spoken to me from
his dwelling place, the sun. He has promised that we
shall have the Great Fire again. But,” she added slowly,
“I am old and my strength has grown small. I must
have help. You must help me.”</p>

<p>How proud the boys were! Gladly they ran at her bidding
to bring the driest sticks they could find. It was
hard to discover many, for the long rain had soaked
everything through and through. But they climbed into
the trees and broke off dead limbs that had become partially
dried out again, and they broke open rotten logs
to get the dry, crumbly wood that lay at their hearts. It
was not very long until they had brought together a nice
supply of dry sticks and light, tindery wood.</p>

<p>Flame was on her knees again when they came back,
and now they could see what she was doing. She had a
long, pointed, hardwood stick in her hands and was twirling
it very fast in a little hollow in a flat block of soft,
dry wood. While she worked she mumbled to herself,
now and then looking up at the sun and speaking as if to
the god that she said lived in it. The boys stood very
still and watched her.</p>

<p>Flame worked a long time. Then she threw down the
pointed stick and wrung her hands.</p>

<p>“I am too old,” she wailed. “No more are my hands
strong to bring the Fire-god to help my people. Oh,
woe is me! woe is me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>Bolo came up timidly and touched her shoulder. He
held out both hands, opening and shutting his wiry brown
fingers.</p>

<p>“My hands are very strong,” he said. “Let them be
as your hands and twirl the stick while you speak to the
Fire-god.”</p>

<p>Then Fisher spoke up eagerly. “Do you not remember
the game we play with the stick and the strap? Do you
remember how very fast we can make it go? Let us
both twirl the stick with the strap while Flame speaks to
the Fire-god.”</p>

<p>So Fisher brought a flat, strong strap made of reindeer
hide and wrapped it around the stick. Then he and Bolo
took hold of the ends and drew them back and forth.</p>

<p>How fast the pointed stick did go! Flame showed
them how to hold it in the hollowed block, then she rose
and once more faced the sun, her arms held toward it and
her lips mumbling a prayer to the Fire-god.</p>

<p>Faster and faster whirled the stick, and louder and
louder prayed Flame. Pretty soon she began stamping
her feet and waving her hands. She moved around the
boys in a circle, her face always toward the sun.</p>

<p><a id="BRef_007" href="#Ref_007">For a long time nothing happened</a>. Then at last Bolo
saw a tiny thread of smoke rising from the hollow.</p>

<p>“The fire is coming,” he shouted. “Pray! pray!”</p>

<p>In another moment a very, very small spark glowed
through the smoke. The eager boys sprinkled crumbs of
dry tinder upon it and soon they had a small blaze. A few
dry sticks made it leap up brightly, and then how Flame
shouted and sang and flung her arms up toward the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>“I have heard the will of the Fire-god,” she said after
a time. “I am old, and he has taken this way to show
me that I must teach someone else to call him. I might
have died in the water, and then who could have helped
the cave people? They must all have died, too. And it
is better that two should know than one, for then the
secret of the Great Fire will not be so easily lost. You
are faithful; you will be faithful. I will teach you. But
first you must carry fire to the people.”</p>

<p>Bolo and Fisher each took a lighted torch and started
back to where the discouraged cave people were huddled
together. How everyone shouted for joy when they saw
the fire coming. They knew that again they were safe
in their homes in the Valley of Caves.</p>

<p>It was not many days until most of the people who
were left were back at home again. Some had been
swept away by the water, some had wandered away when
they found there was no fire, and some had died from
cold and hunger. All felt very sad when they saw how
the water had laid waste their pretty valley.</p>

<p>They had lost all their weapons, too, and old Quickfinger,
who had made most of the spears and harpoons for
the Clan, was nowhere to be found. They thought he
must have died, for they knew he would never have left
them.</p>

<p>Then One Eye showed them what he had carried away
in the great skin bag. He had gathered up all the arrows
he could find, many spear and harpoon heads, and
the flint flakers that Quickfinger and himself had used in
making them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>“I can make better arrows than Quickfinger,” he said.
“Arrows are better than spears or harpoons. I have
taught Bolo, and he will help me make them. I will
teach you, too. The women must make the bowstrings.
Soon we will have plenty of weapons.”</p>

<p>“One Eye is wise and prudent,” cried the cave men
joyfully. “We will do whatever he says. He will take
care of us.”</p>

<p>But they did not know that Flame had taught Bolo and
Fisher a greater lesson than how to make arrows. She
made the boys promise to keep secret what she taught
them. She did not believe it was right for all the Clan
to know how to make fire. She thought the Fire-god
would be angry if she told them.</p>

<p>Years after, when Flame was dead, Bolo and Fisher
thought the rest of the people ought to know, too. They
did not believe the Fire-god would be angry if they
taught them all. So one day, when they were both old
men, they gathered the Clan together—but that is another
story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V
<br><span class="cheaderfont">A Long Search and What Came of It</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Many days went by and still Stitcher did not come back
to the Valley of Caves. One Eye took his bow and arrows
and went here and there among the hills, but nothing
could he find of either Stitcher or little Antelope.
He was very sad, for he remembered how pretty little
Antelope used to run out to meet him when he came
home after a hunt, and what fine shirts of reindeer and
wolf-skins Stitcher made for him. One day he came
back to the caves after being gone a long time. He threw
himself wearily down and said very sadly:</p>

<p>“They are dead. I will search no more.”</p>

<p>But Bolo did not believe his mother was dead.</p>

<p>“I am going to try to find them,” he said. “Make me
a strong bow and a quiver full of fine arrows, for I may
be gone a long time.”</p>

<p>One Eye shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>“You will only die, too,” he said.</p>

<p>But Bolo brought some flint stones and set to making
his arrows. Then One Eye sat down to show him how
to make them more keen and beautiful than any he had
ever made. He took a curved piece of bone and chipped
off the large flakes. Then he pressed off smaller flakes
one by one, working very carefully, until he had made a
fine, keen point. Bolo watched his father and worked<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
in the same way, and soon they had a nice lot of arrows.
Bolo made a new head for his spear, too, and bound it on
with a fresh cord of reindeer sinew.</p>

<p>At last all was ready. One Eye brought a great, hollow
bone that he had taken from the leg of a mammoth years
before and fastened a wooden base to it. He drilled holes
in the upper edge and strung thongs through them so
that Bolo could carry it over his shoulder. Then he put
the arrows into the hollow of the bone. It made a good
quiver.</p>

<p>Bolo carried his bow over one shoulder and his quiver
full of arrows over the other. He carried his spear in
his hand, and at his side he hung a heavy hammer made
of stone. One Eye wanted him to leave the hammer and
take a great club that he had made from the jawbone of
a cave bear, to which one long, sharp tooth was still attached.
But Bolo was afraid of this club. He was
afraid it would make the cave bears angry with him. So
he did not take it. Fisher wanted to go with Bolo, but
Flame said “No.” She had grown very feeble and she
was afraid she might die. If both boys went away and
never came back there would be no one to talk to the
Fire-god. So Fisher stayed to help Flame tend the Great
Fire.</p>

<p>For three days Bolo wandered about over the hills. At
night he tied himself to the branch of a tree, safely out
of the reach of harm, and slept soundly. He shot a rabbit
now and then for food, and sometimes caught a fish.
One day he found himself suddenly surrounded by a pack
of snarling, hungry hyenas, but a few well-aimed arrows<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
sent them scurrying off into the hills. How glad Bolo
was that they were not wolves!</p>

<p>One day Bolo climbed a tall tree that stood alone on a
hill. He hoped he might be able to find some trace of
those he sought. He looked slowly about in every direction.
On one side the hills lay like great, rounded billows,
many of them covered with trees. On the other
side wound the river, in some places between sloping
shores, in others between steep banks. Off toward the
north it disappeared behind a jutting cliff. It was a long
way from Bolo’s tree, but he thought he could see something
moving along the river bank. He looked again
eagerly. Perhaps that might be his mother and little
Antelope.</p>

<p>He climbed down the tree and ran across to another
hilltop closer to the river. Here he climbed another
tree, and from that he saw something so strange that he
held his breath in terrified surprise.</p>

<div id="Ref_025" class="figcenter illowp69" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i033.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“<a href="#BRef_025">Bolo had never seen any animals like this before</a>”</p></div>
</div>

<p>Great, lumbering creatures were moving about along
the edge of the river. They had heavy, swinging snouts,
and from their enormous heads rose in great curves immense,
yellowish things that looked like queer horns.
<a id="BRef_025" href="#Ref_025">Bolo had never seen any animals like these before</a>. He
watched them with fascinated eyes, wondering what they
could be. Sometimes one of them would reach up into a
tree with its great snout and pull a branch down. Two
of them appeared to be quarreling, and one thrust its
shaggy head and wicked looking tusks against the side
of the other and made him stagger. Another waded out
into the river and appeared to be drinking. In a minute<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
he threw his trunk over his back and out spouted a
stream of muddy water. There were fully twice as many of
these animals as there were fingers on both of his hands.</p>

<p>At last Bolo thought again of his mother and little Antelope.
How he hoped they had not been trampled to
death by these dreadful beasts. He had almost given up
finding them now, for he was sure that even if they had
not been drowned or killed by wild beasts they must
have starved. So, sad at heart, he started on the long
journey back to the Valley of Caves.</p>

<p>Weary and heartsick, he came in sight of the caves.
But who was that running up the slope to meet him?
Surely it could not be—yes, it was! It was dear little
Antelope, holding up her baby hands and shouting his
name. Down the hill he ran, forgetting his aching
limbs and heavy heart, and how both laughed and
shouted for joy as he caught his lost sister up and put
her on his shoulder. Together thus, they came to the
cave where Stitcher sat, her brown hands for once idle
as she leaned wearily against the side of a great rock.
She looked very worn and thin, but smiled gladly when
Bolo came up and put his arm about her shoulders.</p>

<p>“We looked everywhere,” he said. “Where have you
been all this time? And how did you live?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you another time,” said Stitcher. “I do
not like to talk about it now.”</p>

<p>How excited Bolo was as he told One Eye and the
other cave men about the strange herd he had seen in the
distant valley. The whole Clan was at once in a turmoil.
One Eye gave it as his opinion that the great animals<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
were mammoths, which rarely came into that region, and
were very valuable for their meat, their skins, and the
ivory in the long tusks. One mammoth would make
meat for all the Clan for many days, and they were all
eager to start at once on a great hunt for them.</p>

<p>“We must take spears and harpoons,” said one.</p>

<p>“No, we must take bows and arrows,” said another.</p>

<p>“We will go up the river and attack them from the
water,” said a third.</p>

<p>“No,” objected a fourth, “that would frighten them
back into the hills and we could not get them.”</p>

<p>In short, each man in the Clan seemed to think he
knew just what to do, and would not listen to anyone
else. For a while it looked as if the great hunt would
have to be given up.</p>

<p>“Why not choose someone who is brave and wise to
lead you, and then all do as he tells you to?” suggested
Bek, the oldest man in the Clan.</p>

<p>No one had thought of that.</p>

<p>“That is right,” said Flame, who had come up to listen.</p>

<p>“But how shall we know who is the wisest?” called
several voices at once.</p>

<p>“Who has done the most for the Clan?” asked old Bek.</p>

<p>“One Eye saved our weapons when the flood came.”</p>

<p>“He taught us to make arrows.”</p>

<p>“He is not afraid.”</p>

<p>“Then let One Eye be the leader,” cried Flame, and
to this they all agreed.</p>

<p>Such a time as there was then! The cave men ran
here and there gathering up spears and arrows and clubs<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
and making themselves ready. The women bound new
points on the spears with heavy sinews, and Bolo helped
his father prepare a number of torches from wood soaked
in fat. Flame brought some other torches made from
knotty pine limbs. They all knew they would need fire
with which to fight the mammoths.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI
<br><span class="cheaderfont">The Hunt for the Mammoths</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a long way to where Bolo had seen the herd, and
they were all afraid the animals might have wandered
away. Bolo and Fisher ran eagerly ahead, and Bolo
pointed out to Fisher the things he had noticed while
searching for his mother. One Eye said very little, but
he sent men up into every tall tree they passed to see if
they could discover the herd. They traveled all day, and
when night came they built a great circle of fire and lay
down to rest. One Eye chose four men to carry torches,
and it was their duty to see that the fires did not go out.</p>

<p>When they came to the valley where Bolo had seen the
mammoths they found nothing but trampled grass and
the broken limbs of trees. They went very slowly and
carefully after that. It was not long till a man, who had
climbed into a very tall tree on a hilltop, called out excitedly
that he could see something moving at the base
of a cliff that hung high and steep above the river. One
Eye climbed the tree himself, and looked long and closely
where the man pointed.</p>

<p>“It is the herd,” he said. “Now let every man do just
as I say.”</p>

<p>He divided the cave men into two parties. One was
to move up very slowly from the side where they were,
the other was to travel rapidly around through a valley<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
behind some hills and come upon the herd from the other
side. Bolo, young as he was, was appointed to lead the
first party, while One Eye himself led the second division
through the valley. The men seemed pleased at this for
they thought Bolo deserved some honor.</p>

<p>When the cave men had surrounded the herd in this
fashion they were to close in upon them, each man
carrying a blazing torch, and try to drive the animals up
the landward slope of the cliff, and over it into the river.
They knew they could never kill one of these huge beasts
with any weapons they had. So they thought to kill
them by driving them over the cliff and making them
fall upon the rocks below. Some of the cave men who
had never seen a mammoth were very much frightened
at the terrible beasts. They said they were going back
to the caves. But the others taunted them and called
them women, until they grew ashamed and went on with
the rest.</p>

<p>Very stealthily and carefully the two bodies of cave
men drew toward the great herd of grazing animals.
One of the older men told in whispers of another such
hunt he had taken part in when a young man. He said
he had never tasted any meat so good as that of the
mammoth.</p>

<p>Bolo watched carefully for his father’s signal. At last
it came, and when he saw the tossing torch he motioned
his men to light their torches and go on quickly.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes the surprised mammoths found
themselves attacked from three sides by a screaming,
leaping line of cave men, each swinging a fiery torch<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
above his head. At first the huge beasts stood still.
Then they turned and went awkwardly up the long slope
on the landward side of the bluff. The men followed as
closely as they dared, for they feared that when the animals
came to the edge of the bluff they would swing
around and rush through the line of their attackers,
trampling them under their great feet.</p>

<p>One Eye was again leading the entire band. Always
he was at the very front, shouting and waving his torch.
One man, more daring than the rest, ran up and thrust
his burning firebrand right against the shaggy side of
the nearest mammoth. The frenzied beast, with a bellow
of rage, turned and tore back through the yelling
mass of hunters. In spite of all their efforts to escape,
two men were killed and three more badly hurt. The
rest of the herd, terrified by the confusion, huddled together
on the edge of the bluff.</p>

<p>“Close in! close in!” shouted One Eye, brandishing
his torch in a fury of excitement. But the cave men were
too much frightened to obey. They were scattered by
the stampeding mammoth, and were too scared and confused
to obey their leader. What made things worse
was that they had never been used to obeying the orders
of anyone.</p>

<p>But Bolo and Fisher obeyed. Bolo had drawn a little
away from the rest of the hunters. He had swung his
stout bow down from his shoulder and carefully fitted an
arrow to the taut string. No one noticed the sharp twang
as the arrow left the bowstring, but all saw one of the
mammoths rear suddenly with pain and plunge into the<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
midst of the herd. Startled at this sudden onslaught, the
herd pressed a little closer to the edge of the cliff, and
then—</p>

<p>Never in all his life did Bolo hear again such a terrific
shriek as the falling mammoth gave. For many nights
after that he covered his ears as he lay down to sleep so
that he might not hear it again in his dreams. Then
came the sickening crash as the gigantic body struck the
rocks below. The men turned and fled, and the remaining
mammoths, in a frenzy of fear, tore back down the
landward side of the cliffs into the valley. For some
moments the hunters, wide-eyed and breathless, watched
the herd as it lumbered down the valley, until at last it
passed behind the hills and was gone.</p>

<p>When the cave men hurried down to the river’s edge
they found the immense, shaggy carcass of the dead
mammoth lying in the shallow water at the base of the
cliff. They could not move it to dry land, so they waded
out to it and went to work to cut it up with their long
flint knives right where it was.</p>

<p>But first they sent four of the swiftest runners back to
the Valley of Caves, and to another Clan who lived far
up the river, to tell them all to come and partake of the
feast. From every direction they came, men, women and
children, and by the time the hunters had the great carcass
cut up and carried to the shore there was a great
gathering of hungry cave people who all rejoiced at the
prospect of so delicious a feast.</p>

<p>They stayed here several days, feasting and resting.
Then, every woman, loaded with meat, and every man,<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
carrying a heavy club to protect the party from attacks
of wild beasts, they took their way back to the Valley of
Caves. They all knew that if the men should carry the
meat themselves they might all be killed by wolves or
other savage beasts. So the men kept themselves ready
to fight while the women bore the burdens.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing when they reached home
again. Every one praised One Eye for his wisdom and
courage, and they all agreed that he should be their
leader as long as he lived.</p>

<p>“Bolo will be as wise as his father,” said Flame.
“Wiser, too, perhaps,” she added, nodding her head
sagely, for she thought of the important secret that no
one in the Clan knew except herself and the two boys.</p>

<p>“Then Bolo shall be our leader after his father is dead,”
said old Bek. But he suspected what Flame meant.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII
<br><span class="cheaderfont">How Stitcher Saved the Clan from Hunger</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Many months passed by and in the Valley of Caves all
was going well again. The flood was almost forgotten.
Nuts and berries were plenty in the woods and the hunters
always came home laden. No one thought very
much about the time when they had been so hungry and
cold and wretched. That is, not many people did. But
Stitcher could never forget the days after the great flood
when she had wandered about in the hills with little
Antelope in her arms, not knowing which way to go,
hungry and weary and in danger. She always shuddered
when she thought of it, and called her little girl up close
to her.</p>

<p>She remembered other times, too, when nuts and berries
were few and game was scarce. She thought there
ought to be some way to get ready for such times so the
cave people would not need to suffer so much. So one
day when the men brought in great quantities of meat
she cut some in strips and hid it in the top of the cave.</p>

<p>“I will keep this till the rest of the meat is gone,” said
Stitcher. But she told no one what she had done.</p>

<p>It was a long time before Stitcher thought of the meat
again. Then she only remembered it because she happened
to think of that terrible time when she had been
so hungry. She reached up in the top of the cave and<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
brought down the strips, and behold! the meat was deliciously
smoked and dried by the heat of the fire.</p>

<p>“It is good,” she said, and gave some to One Eye to
taste.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is good,” he said, reaching for more.</p>

<p>“After this we will not need to go hungry any more,”
said Stitcher, “for when the hunting is good we will
save meat.”</p>

<p>“How wise and thoughtful you are,” said One Eye.</p>

<p>There was something else that Stitcher did not think
of for a long time. When she was so far from home,
and little Antelope was crying for food, she had found
some strange stalks that had grains like tiny brown berries
in a sort of husk at their tip. She shook some of
these berries out and gave them to Antelope, and ate
some herself. They tasted a little like nut meats but
were even better.</p>

<p>Stitcher had brought some of these grains home in her
doe-skin pouch. She carried them to eat on the way, but
she did not eat them all up. When she got back to the
caves she threw the rest of the berries out on the ground.
A few days after that she noticed some particularly
bright grass growing where she had thrown the grains.
But she did not think that it might have grown from
them.</p>

<p>The grains had fallen in a sheltered place where the
new green blades were not trampled down. In time the
stalks became yellow and dry, and at their tips were
more husks filled with smooth brown grains. When
Stitcher saw them she cried out in delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>“They are like the berries I scattered on the ground,”
she exclaimed. “I will scatter these again. I like to see
them grow.”</p>

<p>So, instead of eating the brown kernels, Stitcher shook
them all out of the husks on the ground. This time she
watched them, and was careful to see that no one walked
upon them. After a long time there were more yellow
stalks and more sweet, nutty grains.</p>

<p>“Here are a great many berries,” said Stitcher, as she
shook them out into a big wooden bowl. “We will eat
some of them. But most of them I will scatter again.
By and by there will be enough so we can all have some
of them to eat.”</p>

<p>After that Stitcher had some grain growing near her
cave all the time. Many heard of this wonderful new
food and came long distances to get some of the kernels.
And soon most of the cave people were raising little
patches of wheat in the open spaces about their caves.</p>

<p>“We will never be hungry again,” said Stitcher.</p>

<p>Years after that Stitcher lost all her teeth and could not
eat the hard grains. So she put some of them into a
hollowed stone and pounded them with another stone till
they were soft. In this way the cave people came at last
to grind grain for bread. But it was many, many years
before they learned how to do that. For a long time
they ate it just as it came from the husk.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII
<br><span class="cheaderfont">The Pictures on the Wall</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Bek, the oldest man in the Clan, lived in a cave not
very far from the one where Flame kept the Great Fire.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful cave, more wonderful even, the
boys thought, than Flame’s. They were almost afraid
to go into it, however, for the cave people thought old
Bek had the power of making charms.</p>

<p>One day as Bolo peeped into Bek’s cave the old man
was drawing a picture on a smooth place on the rock
wall. He had a queer little lamp made of hollowed chalk-stone.
This was filled with fat. Into the fat Bek had
stuck a bit of the pith of a water-rush. He could light
this little chalk-cup lamp and go on with his pictures
when he had no need for fire.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" style="max-width: 27.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i042.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Picture of a Mammoth Cut in Ivory by a Cave Man and Found in one of the
Caves of France.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“What are you doing?” asked Bolo.</p>

<p>“Come and see,” said Bek.</p>

<p>When Bolo went closer he saw that it was a drawing
of a reindeer. He watched as Bek added line after line,
bringing out the graceful curve of the neck, the turn of
the long, branching horns, and the dainty, slender legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>“I should like to make a picture, too,” said Bolo eagerly.</p>

<p>“You may try,” said Bek, handing him the bit of
brown soft stone he had been using.</p>

<p>So Bolo tried and tried, but when he was done no one
could have told what it was he had been trying to draw.</p>

<p>“I will make pictures yet some day,” cried Bolo, throwing
down the stone. “I will make the cave bear I killed,
and the mammoths.”</p>

<p>“See here, now,” said Bek.</p>

<p>He took a large, smooth piece of the tusk of the mammoth
the cave men had killed. One Eye had given him
one of the ivory tusks because he knew the old man
loved beautiful things, and the ivory was very smooth
and beautiful. Then he took a sharp flint awl and began
to make deep, careful marks in the ivory. Bolo
watched him with great interest.</p>

<p>“Why, it is the mammoth itself,” he cried at last.
“Only wait, Bek; the great tusk did not curve up quite
like that. It was more like this.”</p>

<p>Bolo took the awl and made a mark that he thought
showed more nearly how the tusk looked. Yet he was
not quite satisfied and tried again, and the next time
both he and Bek declared that the curve was right.</p>

<p>“Now we must put in the long hair,” said Bek, drawing
short, straight lines down over the animal’s head
and shoulders. “There, now! here is the eye, too, and
the big, flapping ears. Ah, ha, my Bolo, we must show
this to One Eye and see what he says.”</p>

<p>When One Eye saw the drawing he became very grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p>“It is a charm,” he said. “Whoever carries that can
never be harmed by a mammoth.”</p>

<p>So he bored a hole through one end of the ivory and
ran a thong through it. Then he hung it about Bolo’s
neck. The lad was very proud of his new ornament and
showed everybody the wonderful picture Bek had made.</p>

<p>Day after day Bolo worked with Bek in his cave. Many
were the drawings he made, or tried to make, and at
last old Bek began to say he was doing very well.</p>

<p>“The animals like to have us make their pictures,”
said Bek. “They think we want to be friends with them
when we do that.”</p>

<p>“I will make them look more like animals,” said Bolo.
“I will cut them out with my flint knife.” So after he had
drawn a picture of a reindeer he cut it out very carefully.</p>

<p>Now it was Bek’s turn to be surprised.</p>

<p>“I had never thought of doing that,” he said. So he,
too, tried to carve pictures of animals he had drawn.</p>

<p>By and by other cave men began to be interested in
the pictures that Bek and Bolo made, and soon many of
the men were trying their skill. The women brought a
sort of red and brown clay, and painted the animals after
the men had drawn them on the cave walls.</p>

<p>And although all this was thousands and thousands of
years ago, the drawings and paintings are still to be seen.
They tell us many things more than have been related
here about the cave men of Bolo’s time. They tell us
of another animal, more terrible than the cave bear or
the mammoth, the dreaded Sabre-Tooth, striped with
rich, velvety brown like a tiger, and strong and bloodthirsty<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
as a lion. They tell us of the ways in which the
cave men fought and lived and learned, and so came to
know many things that were never dreamed of in the
days of Bolo. But all that is another story.</p>

<p>What is of more interest to us just now is to know that
when Flame died, many years after the great hunt, Fisher
was made Keeper of the Great Fire in her stead. This
was the highest honor the Clan could show, excepting
only the honor they had shown to One Eye when they
made him their leader.</p>

<p>“Bolo must learn many things,” said One Eye. “I am
growing old and the Clan must never again be without a
lawmaker. And the man who is to make the laws must
be fearless and wise and good.”</p>

<p>It was long after that, however, before Bolo took his
place at the head of the Clan. For One Eye lived to an
old age, and became wiser and more just with every year.</p>

<p>Little Antelope grew up as pretty and graceful as the
beautiful animal whose name she bore. When the young
Chief of another Clan, living in a valley far across the
hills, saw her as she sat sewing skins beside her mother,
and called to her to follow him, she did so gladly, for he
was tall and brave and handsome.</p>

<p>There was another pretty maiden, too, whom Bolo
thought the loveliest he had ever seen. So, one day he
found a new cave, where no one had ever lived, and
made it ready for his own home.</p>

<p>But how he won the maiden, and what brave deeds he
did in his long after years cannot be told here. That,
too, is another story.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
